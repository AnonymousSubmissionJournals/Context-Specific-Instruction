## Overview
This study evaluates the impact of **context-specific debugging instruction** on novice programmers. It includes:  
- Longitudinal performance data (correctness, time-to-completion).  
- Qualitative feedback (cognitive load, satisfaction).  
- Code snippets and debugging tasks used in the experiment.  
- Analysis scripts for reproducibility.
